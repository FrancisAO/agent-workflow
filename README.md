# Introduction
- Agent Workflow provides a set of agents with specific capabilities.
- These agents can be used to define static workflows in a custom YAML configuration.
- The artifacts generated by the agents are stored in a database.
- If necessary, the artifacts are also stored in any local directories.

# Classification of agent-workflow
The agent-workflow system is based on the distinction between workflows and agents, as defined in the architectural analysis of agentic systems.

While agents dynamically control their own processes and independently determine the use of tools, workflows are orchestrated by predefined code paths. The agent-workflow system belongs to the workflow category: It coordinates the use of LLMs and tools based on explicitly implemented procedures, thus ensuring deterministic and controllable process execution. However, the workflows themselves can be customized as desired.

This clear structure enables targeted control over the execution steps and ensures that the system processes remain traceable and repeatable.
