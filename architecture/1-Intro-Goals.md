# 1 Introduction and Goals
This section provides an introduction to the system "Agent-Workflow" and outlines the basic objectives it is designed to achieve.

## 1.1 Scope
- Agent Workflow provides a set of agents with specific capabilities.
- These agents can be used to define static workflows in a custom YAML configuration.
- The artifacts generated by the agents are stored in a database.
- If necessary, the artifacts are also stored in any local directories.

Important note: Agents inside this system are software components. Some of them may interact
with an llm, others may not.

## 1.2 Quality Goals
Q1: Declarative specification of workflows
- Workflows should be specified in a configuration file (YAML). This should enable
different workflows to be executed without programmatic adjustments.

Q2: Restartability
- If errors occur during the execution of a workflow, e.g., because an LLM is unavailable,
the workflow can be continued at the same point at a later time.

## 1.3 Stakeholder
FrancisAO
- Currently the only developer and user of the system.
- Wants to develop this system as the early version of an fully autonomous agent system.
