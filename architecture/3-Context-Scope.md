# 3. Context and Scope
This section describes the boundaries of the system from its communication partners, including adjacent systems and users. The external interfaces are specified. If necessary, a distinction is made between the business context (domain-specific inputs and outputs) and the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

A clear understanding of these interfaces is essential, as they are among the most critical aspects of the system.
